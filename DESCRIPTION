Description: This package provides a straightforward method for managing secrets. 
          It enables users to store secrets in a designated file, 
          ensuring they are not directly embedded in shared code. 
          While it prioritizes ease of use, please note that secrets are stored without encryption. 
          For secrets used both R and Python, 
          this package is compatible with the 'SecretsProvider' Python package <https://pypi.org/project/SecretsProvider/>.
